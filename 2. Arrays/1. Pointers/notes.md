```
int a;
// size of memory allocated for variable a depends on data type and compiler
```

int - 4 bytes
char- 1 byte
float- 4 bytes

int ** q //pointer to a pointer. Will only store address of pointer to an integer

int *** r // will only store address of (** p) kind of variable.

Think r+1, \*r+1, \**r+1, \***r+1.
