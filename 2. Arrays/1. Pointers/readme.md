  * 2.png. Shows why pointers are strongly typed
    * Helps in dereferencing. How many bytes of memory should i read?
    * Helps in pointer arithmetic
  * 2.cpp. pointers are strongly typed. typecasting int and char pointers
  * 3.cpp. void pointer
  * 4.cpp. pointer to pointer
  * 5.cpp (Use of pointers- As function arguments. Call by reference. Examples- swap and increment)
    * Call by reference saves memory usage.

  * 7.cpp. Arrays as function arguments
  * 8.cpp. ways to create char arrays
  * Strings in C++ are just arrays of characters, or Character Arrays
    * size of array >= number of chars in array +1. We need to store null char at end of string to denote the string ends. Strings must be null terminated.
    * char c[4]- Character Arrays. And c- string

  * 9.cpp. printing char arrays
  * 10.cpp. some property of char array
  * 10.jpg. Notice the variable c in 2 different functions. It has different sizes
  * 11.md Pointers and 2-D arrays, multidim arrays
