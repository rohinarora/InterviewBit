  * 2.png. Shows why pointers are strongly typed
    * Helps in dereferencing. How many bytes of memory should i read?
    * Helps in pointer arithmetic
  * 2.cpp. pointers are strongly typed. typecasting int and char pointers
  * 3.cpp. void pointer
  * 4.cpp. pointer to pointer
  * 5.cpp (Use of pointers- As function arguments. Call by reference. Examples- swap and increment)
    * Call by reference saves memory usage.

  * Arrays as function arguments (7.cpp)
  * Strings in C++ are just arrays of characters, or Character Arrays
    * Character Arrays    
      size of array >= number of chars in array +1. We need to store null char at end of string to denote the string ends. Strings must be null terminated.
